Frequency is the total number of observations.
A frequency distribution table lists the number of observations per category.

Relative frequency is the measure of proportion of observations.
A relative frequency distribution table lists the percent of observations within each category.
relative frequency = frequency / n

**Top Box Score**
Sum of 2 top relative frequencies.
40% + 30% = 70%

**Bottom Box Score**
Sum of 2 lowest relative frequencies.
5% + 10% = 15%
