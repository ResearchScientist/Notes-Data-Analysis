# Frequency

Frequency is the total number of observations.
A frequency distribution table lists the number of observations per category.

Relative frequency is the measure of proportion of observations.
A relative frequency distribution table lists the percent of observations within each category.
relative frequency = frequency / n

**Top Box Score**
Sum of 2 top relative frequencies.
40% + 30% = 70%

**Bottom Box Score**
Sum of 2 lowest relative frequencies.
5% + 10% = 15%

# Measures of Central Tendency

### Mean

Average of all values in a given variable.

`sum of all values for a variable / n observations`
### Median

Middle value of a sorted data set (ordinal data).

for odd dataset the median value is at `( n + 1 ) / 2`

for even dataset the median values are at `n / 2` and `( n / 2 ) + 1`
### Mode

Value that appears the most often in a data set.

Confidence Level

Probability that the sample size represents the population.

# Margin of Error

Maximum variance between sample and population.
